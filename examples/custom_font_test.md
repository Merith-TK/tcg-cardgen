# Custom Font Card

This card demonstrates **custom font sizing** using MTG-specific metadata.

The title is smaller (28px instead of 32px), the body text is smaller (18px instead of 20px), and the type line is also smaller (22px instead of 24px).

This allows card designers to have **precise control** over typography for their specific card needs.
