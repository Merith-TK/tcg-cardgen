# Tiny Text Spell
> {{tcg.cost_blue}}

> **Instant**

This card has **incredibly verbose rules text** that requires smaller fonts to fit properly. It demonstrates how card designers can specify exact font sizes for their specific needs.

**Choose three different modes:**

• Target player draws a card, then discards a card
• Target creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn
• Target player gains 3 life
• Deal 1 damage to any target
• Counter target spell unless its controller pays {{tcg.cost_colorless(1)}}

**Additional rules:** If you control three or more artifacts, you may choose an additional mode. If you control five or more artifacts, you may choose all modes instead.
