This is a very long spell description that should test the word wrapping functionality. It contains multiple sentences with lots of descriptive text that would normally overflow the text box if word wrapping wasn't implemented properly.

When you cast this spell, it does many things in sequence. First, it draws you cards equal to the number of words in this very long rules text. Then, it creates token creatures based on the complexity of the spell itself.

The spell also has a very complicated targeting restriction that requires you to choose targets in a specific order, and those targets must meet certain criteria that are explained in great detail in this unnecessarily verbose rules text.
