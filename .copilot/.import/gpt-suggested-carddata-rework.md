Excellent ‚Äî that‚Äôs a *very* solid choice. The hybrid layout gives you both **clarity for humans** and **structure for your renderer** without sacrificing flexibility.

Here‚Äôs how we can formalize that schema so it‚Äôs both intuitive for players *and* consistent enough for parsing.

---

## üß© Hybrid YAML Schema (Human-Friendly + Structured)

### üóÇ General layout

Each card YAML file will follow this predictable order:

```yaml
card:        # Universal card info
mtg:         # (or ygo:, pk:, etc.) ‚Äî game-specific data
text:        # Freeform card text + flavor
```

---

### ü™∂ Example ‚Äî Magic: The Gathering

```yaml
card:
  tcg: mtg
  title: Black Lotus
  type: Artifact
  rarity: rare
  set: Alpha
  artist: Christopher Rush
  print_this: 1
  print_total: 1

mtg:
  cmc: 0
  mana_cost: ["{0}"]

text:
  rules:
    - "{T}, Sacrifice Black Lotus: Add three mana of any one color."
  flavor:
    - "The most powerful artifact ever created, torn from the hands of a planeswalker."
```

### üîÆ Example ‚Äî Yu-Gi-Oh! (different structure, same layout)

```yaml
card:
  tcg: ygo
  title: Blue-Eyes White Dragon
  rarity: ultra_rare
  set: LOB
  artist: Kazuki Takahashi
  print_this: 1
  print_total: 1

ygo:
  level: 8
  attribute: LIGHT
  type: Dragon / Normal
  atk: 3000
  def: 2500

text:
  description:
    - "This legendary dragon is a powerful engine of destruction."
    - "Virtually invincible, very few have faced this awesome creature and lived to tell the tale."
```

## üß† Parser / Render Logic Concept

When rendering or processing:

1. Look for `card.tcg` ‚Üí determines which ruleset to use.
2. Merge `card` + that section (e.g., `mtg`, `ygo`) into a unified structure.
3. Pass that to your template system (`cardstyle.yaml`).
4. Missing values fall back to defaults in the style definition or engine settings.

This makes it **self-descriptive** ‚Äî no need to define schemas separately for every TCG.

---

## üõ† Extensibility Example

For a custom or homebrew game, a user could do:

```yaml
card:
  tcg: "mygame"
  title: "Solar Knight"
  rarity: uncommon
  set: Core Set
  artist: Luna Grey

mygame:
  energy_cost: 3
  element: Light
  health: 12
  attack: 8

text:
  rules:
    - "While this unit is active, all Light cards cost 1 less energy."
  flavor:
    - "He carries the dawn wherever he strides."
```

Your renderer just needs to look for `tcg: mygame` and use the matching style config.

---

## ‚úÖ Benefits

* **Users** get clean, intuitive structure.
* **Developers** get consistent key names for automation.
* **TCG creators** can fork existing schemas without cluttering the root level.
* **Card styles** can easily test conditions like `{{card.tcg == 'mtg'}}` or `{{mtg.cmc}}`.

---

Would you like me to draft a *reference schema* (like a `.yml` or JSON schema) that your parser can use to validate these card files ‚Äî e.g., ensuring `card.tcg` exists, checking for missing fields, and defining optional ones per TCG type?
